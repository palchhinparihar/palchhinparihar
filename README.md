# Hi there, I'm [Palchhin](https://palchhin.me)! :)

Welcome to my GitHub! A tech girlie here, who loves working on the frontend because it feels like building my own little world on a screen - choosing the flow, colors, and motion. Most days I’m in React with Tailwind or Bootstrap, and I also handle the backend with the MERN stack, so everything connects.

I’ve completed 2 freelance projects and am currently working on my 3rd, shaping both front and back into seamless experiences.
